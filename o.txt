The fact that Ove has been following this routine for the last 40 years makes it clear that he needs this routine. His reaction to the cat then suggests that his routine is easy to upset with even the smallest thing. His thought about self-employed people suggests that the demographics on the street have changed a lot in the last 40 years. Note that it’s suggested that Ove’s wife is present with him and having coffee as well, though it’s later revealed that this isn’t the case. The narrator notes that when Ove was the chairman of the Residents' Association, he tried unsuccessfully to get cameras installed in the trash room. Two years later, when Ove was no longer the chairman and the question of cameras came up again, Ove voted against cameras because he doesn't trust the internet, and the proposed cameras uploaded footage to the internet directly. He looks at his ceiling and decides that he's going to put a hook up today that will impress the real estate agents who Ove knows will be wandering through his house in a few days. One of his "useful stuff" boxes full of screws is next to him, and the narrator explains that Ove and his wife divide their house into useful things that are Ove's, and lovely things that are hers. Ove studies his ceiling and comes up with a plan to screw in the appropriate kind of hook while lamenting the fact that now that he's forcibly retired, he has no purpose. As he studies his ceiling, he's interrupted by the sound of something scraping along his outside wall.
